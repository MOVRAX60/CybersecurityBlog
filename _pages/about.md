I have undertaken the creation of this platform with the intention of meticulously recording my diverse undertakings centered on cybersecurity and administration. The content showcased here and on my GitHub repository primarily revolves around Incident Response, Digital Forensics, Offensive Security, and DevOps. My academic background includes an MS in Information Technology and Cybersecurity, alongside certifications such as GCIH, GCFA, and GNFA.
